One classic root cause for this message is:

when the repo has been initialized (git init lis4368/assignments),
but no commit has ever been made
Ie, if you don't have added and committed at least once, there won't be a local master branch to push to.

Try git commit -m "first commit" and then try git push -u origin master again.
